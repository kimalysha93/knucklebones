# Recreating Knucklebones
This practice project was created for the purpose of learning the Game Development engine, [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), by using it to implement a pre-existing game.

Knucklebones is a Dice minigame found in [Cult of the Lamb](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313140/Cult_of_the_Lamb/). The rules and basic game mechanics can be found on this [wiki page](https://cult-of-the-lamb.fandom.com/wiki/Knucklebones).


## Play the Game in-browser
- For the smoothest experience, the game should be played in fullscreen mode (press F11 on Windows or âŒ˜ + Ctrl + F on Mac)
- Please note the quit button will likely not work in browser. Exit full screen mode and close the tab to exit the game instead
- Play the game [HERE](https://kimalysha93.github.io/knucklebones/)

## Features
- Player can place a die on their grid (bottom one) during their turn
- When a die is eliminated from the opposing side, the remaining dice in the column will shift towards the center
- Implemented a basic Opponent AI
